# 0x00 Shell Basics

In this task, I am practicing fundamental command line commands using bash scripting. These commands are essential for navigating and interacting with the Linux command line. All commands listed here are tested and can be executed on an Ubuntu system.

## Task Objectives

The main objectives of this exercise are as follows:
1. To familiarize myself with basic command line operations.
2. To practice using the following commands:
   - `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
   - `ls`: List directory contents.
   - `ls -la`: List directory contents in a long format, including hidden files.
   - `ls -l`: List directory contents in a long format.
   - Additional command line commands (list other commands you've practiced).

## How to Run

You can execute these commands directly on an Ubuntu system terminal. Here's a brief description of each command:

### Print Current Working Directory (pwd)

```bash
pwd
```

The `pwd` command displays the path of the current working directory.

### List Directory Contents (ls)

```bash
ls
```

The `ls` command is used to list the contents of the current directory.

### List Directory Contents (Long Format) (ls -l)

```bash
ls -l
```

The `ls -l` command lists the contents of the current directory in a long format, providing additional details like permissions, owner, group, file size, modification date, and file/directory names.

### List Directory Contents (Long Format, Including Hidden Files) (ls -la)

```bash
ls -la
```

The `ls -la` command lists the contents of the current directory in a long format, including hidden files and directories.

## Additional Commands

List any additional command line commands you have practiced here, along with a brief description of their usage.
